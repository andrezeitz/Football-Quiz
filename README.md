## Design

### Fonts
I have chosen PT Sans for the header and logo as it is easy to read and has sufficient contrast to the main body font. The small caps style is used by Open Sans that I feelt look very clean in the quiz.!

### Colours
The site follows a kind of football theme color theme to make people almost feel like they are on that football pitch.
It features complementary Lincoln Green, Forest Green Web, Light Green, white and black to create a good contrast and improve readability.

The colours chosen are:

### Contrast Checker
All colours was check in contrast checker and pass the test. The only color that diden't pass for small text was #1E8534 as background to #FFF, but I only use this setup for large text in header and footer.

### Different Screen Size
I was using Chrome as my main browser and the website have been tested on my iPhone 11 Pro and Macbook Pro 13Â¨.

I also tested the website inside of Chrome Dev Tools. With different px sizes to make sure the website will work on all different devices.

### Issues found during site development
* I had a problem that the "Start Quiz" button would not show with any background on ONLY iPhones. Desktop and Andriod phones could see it. I fixed the problem to add a white background to the start button in media media queries for mobile.

* I had a problem to get the score system to work perfectly in the beggining. I forgot to define the "userScore" inside of the function "optionSelected" and it made the score text to not show up inside of the result box.

* Also I had some problem to get the quiz box to fit perfect in between the header and footer on mobile devices. I solved that problem to inside the media queries make the font-size smaller inside the quiz box and also made the header and footer smaller to better fit mobile divices.
